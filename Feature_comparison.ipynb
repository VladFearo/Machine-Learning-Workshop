    "שלב זה בפרויקט נועד להקנות לכם ידע על כלים קיימים לביצוע features extractions. לשם כך חובה לבחור מסד נתונים קיים עם מידע על מנת להתנסות עם הכלים עליו. דוגמאות למסדי נתונים מפורטים בסוף המסמך הזה. אין חובה לבחור אחד מהם.\n",
    "\n",
    "יש לבחור לפחות 4 כלים שונים לביצוע features extraction ו-features selection ולהשתמש בהם על מסד נתונים לבחירתכם.\n",
    "אתם נדרשים להגיש סקירה קצרה (לא יותר מעמוד) של פירוט כל השלבים שביצעתם עם כל אחד מהכלים על מסד הנתונים שלכם.\n",
    "בזמן הבדיקות דאגו לגלות ולהתנסות ביכולות השונות של כל כלי.\n",
    "בדוח הסופי, הנוסף לפירוט כל השלבים שנעשו יש לצרף מספר פסקאות המסכמות את קלות ונוחות העבודה עם כל כלי וכן השוואות בין הכלים השונים – מה היה יותר נוח? מה פחות? איזה כלי יותר מוצלח לסוג אחד של נתונים ואיזה לאחר?\n",
    "נסו לחשוב הלאה לשימושים עתידיים אפשריים שלכם בכל אחד מהכלים ודרגו איזה יהיה יותר שימושי לכם ומתי. חשבו מה למדתם מהתנסות זאת ופרטו זאת.\n",

    "שימו לב כי אתם מוזמנים להשתמש בכל מאגר מידע זמין, אמין וגדול מספיק לשם ביצוע הפרויקט. במידה ומצאתם מאגר מידע עצמאי חובה לצרף את מקור המידע בסקירה עצמה.\n",

    "• https://www.kaggle.com/datasets - מעל ל-100 מאגרי מידע שהועלו על ידי גולשים (ישנם מספר נושאים איזוטריים ומעניינים כמו סטטיסטיקות על משחקי מחשב)\n",
